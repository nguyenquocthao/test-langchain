LLMs: Large Language Models, take a text string as input, return a text string

A word is a unit of language that has meaning and is typically separated by spaces in written text. For example, "cat", "dog", "house", and "apple" are all words in the English language.

A token, on the other hand, is a sequence of characters that represents a unit of meaning in a text. Tokens can be words, but they can also be punctuation marks, numbers, or any other sequence of characters that are meaningful in a given context. For example, in the sentence "I have 2 cats.", there are four tokens: "I", "have", "2", and "cats". "2" is a token, but not a word, because it represents a number rather than a linguistic unit.
