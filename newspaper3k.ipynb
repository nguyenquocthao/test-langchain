(NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced financial\\n\\nresults for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 .\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said: “We are pleased with our business performance in the first\\n\\nquarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored\\n\\nin deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see\\n\\nhuge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation.”\\n\\nRuth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said: “Resilience in Search and momentum in Cloud resulted in Q1\\n\\nconsolidated revenues of $69.8 billion, up 3% year over year, or up 6% in constant currency. We remain committed\\n\\nto delivering long-term growth and creating capacity to invest in our most compelling growth areas by re-engineering\\n\\nour cost base.”\\n\\nQ1 2023 financial highlights (unaudited)\\n\\nOur first quarter 2023 results reflect:\\n\\ni.$2.6 billion in charges related to reductions in our workforce and office space;\\n\\nii.a $988 million reduction in depreciation expense from the change in estimated useful life of our servers and\\n\\ncertain network equipment; and\\n\\niii.a shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards resulting in relatively less\\n\\nstock-based compensation expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of\\n\\nthe ye ar. The shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the\\n\\nfull fiscal year 2023.\\n\\nFor further information, please refer to our blog post also filed with the SEC via Form 8-K on April 20, 2023.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2023\\n\\n(in millions, except for per share information and percentages).\\n\\nQuarter Ended March 31,\\n\\n2022 2023\\n\\nRevenues $ 68,011 $ 69,787\\n\\nChange in revenues year over year 23 % 3 %\\n\\nChange in constant currency revenues year over year(1) 26 % 6 %\\n\\nOperating income $ 20,094 $ 17,415\\n\\nOperating margin 30 % 25 %\\n\\nOther income (expense), net $ (1,160) $ 790\\n\\nNet income $ 16,436 $ 15,051\\n\\nDiluted EPS $ 1.23 $ 1.17\\n\\n(1) Non-GAAP measure.

Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation\\n\\nmethodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making . Prior periods have\\n\\nbeen recast to reflect the revised presentation and are shown in Recast Historical Segment Results below .\\n\\nAs announced on April 20, 2023 , we are bringing together part of Google Research (the Brain Team) and DeepMind\\n\\nto significantly accelerate our progress in AI. This change does not affect first quarter reporting.

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales\\n\\nof apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as\\n\\nYouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\\n\\n•Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\\n\\nenterprise customers.

(NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced financial\\n\\nresults for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 .\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said: “We are pleased with our business performance in the first\\n\\nquarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored\\n\\nin deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see\\n\\nhuge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation.”\\n\\nRuth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said: “Resilience in Search and momentum in Cloud resulted in Q1\\n\\nconsolidated revenues of $69.8 billion, up 3% year over year, or up 6% in constant currency. We remain committed\\n\\nto delivering long-term growth and creating capacity to invest in our most compelling growth areas by re-engineering\\n\\nour cost base.”\\n\\nQ1 2023 financial highlights (unaudited)\\n\\nOur first quarter 2023 results reflect:\\n\\ni.$2.6 billion in charges related to reductions in our workforce and office space;\\n\\nii.a $988 million reduction in depreciation expense from the change in estimated useful life of our servers and\\n\\ncertain network equipment; and\\n\\niii.a shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards resulting in relatively less\\n\\nstock-based compensation expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of\\n\\nthe ye ar. The shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the\\n\\nfull fiscal year 2023.\\n\\nFor further information, please refer to our blog post also filed with the SEC via Form 8-K on April 20, 2023.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2023\\n\\n(in millions, except for per share information and percentages).\\n\\nQuarter Ended March 31,\\n\\n2022 2023\\n\\nRevenues $ 68,011 $ 69,787\\n\\nChange in revenues year over year 23 % 3 %\\n\\nChange in constant currency revenues year over year(1) 26 % 6 %\\n\\nOperating income $ 20,094 $ 17,415\\n\\nOperating margin 30 % 25 %\\n\\nOther income (expense), net $ (1,160) $ 790\\n\\nNet income $ 16,436 $ 15,051\\n\\nDiluted EPS $ 1.23 $ 1.17\\n\\n(1) Non-GAAP measure.

We are focused on rapidly growing production, investments in autonomy\\n\\nand vehicle software, and remaining on track with our growth investments.\\n\\nOur near -term pricing strategy considers a long -term view on per vehicle\\n\\nprofitability given the potential lifetime value of a Tesla vehicle through autonomy,\\n\\nsupercharging, connectivity and service. We expect that our product pricing will\\n\\ncontinue to evolve, upwards or downwards, depending on a number of factors.\\n\\nAlthough we implemented price reductions on many vehicle models across regions\\n\\nin the first quarter, our operating margins reduced at a manageable rate. We\\n\\nexpect ongoing cost reduction of our vehicles, including improved production\\n\\nefficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and remain focused on\\n\\noperating leverage as we scale.\\n\\nWe are rapidly growing energy storage production capacity at our Megafactory in\\n\\nLathrop and we recently announced a new Megafactory in Shanghai. We are also\\n\\ncontinuing to execute on our product roadmap, including Cybertruck, our next\\n\\ngeneration vehicle platform, autonomy and other AI enabled products.\\n\\nOur balance sheet and net income enable us to continue to make these capital\\n\\nexpenditures in line with our future growth.
